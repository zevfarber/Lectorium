# Plan — Alf Layla wa-Layla (Calcutta II, vol. 1)

## Phase 1 — transcription (this routine)

Source: `source/calcutta2-vol1-p<A>-<B>.pdf`, 50 PDF pages per chunk, PDF pages 1–938.
Arabic text: PDF pages 19–938 = printed pp. 1–920 **for PDF pages up to 47**. Eight PDF pages
claimed per run, but a run's archive may cover fewer printed pages if the scan holds a
duplicate leaf (see below) — never guess the mapping, read each batch's first page's own
printed header number against the expected value before transcribing.

**Offset correction (found 2026-09-17, see QUESTIONS.md):** PDF pages 48 and 49 are duplicate
re-scans of printed pp. 28 and 29 (confirmed by direct image comparison), not new pages 30 and
31. They were excluded from the archive. **From PDF page 50 onward, printed = PDF − 20** (not
PDF − 18), confirmed against PDF page 50's own printed header "٣٠", until/unless another such
scan anomaly turns up later in the volume.

| status | PDF pages | printed pp. | archive | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| done (pilot, by eye) | 19–21 | 1–3 | root `nights-frame-01-source.json` | pilot text; p. 3 re-done below |
| done (attended, 2026-09-16) | 21–30 | 3–12 | `archive/pp003-012.json` | frame story to the start of Night 1 |
| done (2026-09-16, unattended) | 31–38 | 13–20 | `archive/pp013-020.json` | Third Sheikh's tale; ends at the frame's return to the merchant/jinni |
| done (2026-09-17, unattended) | 39–46 | 21–28 | `archive/pp021-028.json` | fisherman-and-jinni tale continues; frame's poem, second sheikh's tale opens (King Yunan and the physician Duban) |
| done (2026-09-17, unattended) | 47, 50–54 (48–49 excluded, duplicate leaves) | 29–34 | `archive/pp029-034.json` | King Yunan and Duban tale ends (Duban's execution scene); the Sindbad-the-falconer frame opens and runs to the ghouleh encounter and prince's prayer |
| next | 55–62 | 35–42 | `archive/pp035-042.json` | printed = PDF − 20 until told otherwise; verify PDF 55's header reads "٣٥" before trusting this |
| … | … | … | … | one archive per run |
| end | ~933–938 (offset now −20; recheck near the end) | ~913–920 | | then create `DONE` |

**Last PDF page done: 54 (archive ends at printed p. 34). Pages remaining: ~884 (approximate,
pending the corrected offset holding). Lines archived: 700. calc.traineddata last retrained
2026-09-17 (+89 lines from pp. 29-32, prose only; pp. 33-34 excluded from training — their line
crops don't map 1:1 to printed lines, see LOG). Next retrain when lines archived pass 900.

## Phase 2 — reading edition (not yet scheduled)

Re-cut the archives into nights (`arabic-nights-conventions.md`, "Chunking"), then the usual
Lectorium pipeline per night: vocalisation, two translation layers, morphemic glossary into the
shared `nights-glossary.json`, notes, audio (`ar-XA`). The pilot `nights-frame-01` is the model.
Design this phase once ~50 pages of clean text exist; do not start it inside this routine.
